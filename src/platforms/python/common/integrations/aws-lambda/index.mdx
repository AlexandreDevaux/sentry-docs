You can instrument your AWS Lambda functions in different ways:

* Without touching your code. Configurable from within the Sentry product see the [AWS Lambda Cloud Monitoring product guide](/product/integrations/cloud-monitoring/aws-lambda/).
* By adding a AWS Lambda Layer to your functions. See <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aws-lambda/manual-layer/">AWS Lambda Layer</PlatformLink>.
* Manually in your functions code. See <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aws-lambda/manual-instrumentation/">AWS Lambda Manual Instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
* By adding Sentry to your AWS Lambda container image. See <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aws-lambda/container-image/">AWS Lambda Container Image</PlatformLink>.
