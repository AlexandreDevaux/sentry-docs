You can instrument your AWS Lambda functions in different ways:

- Without touching your code. Configurable from within the Sentry product. See [AWS Lambda Cloud Monitoring Product Guide](/product/integrations/cloud-monitoring/aws-lambda/).
- By adding the Sentry Lambda Layer manually to your function. See <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aws-lambda/manual-layer/">AWS Lambda Layer</PlatformLink>.
- Manually adding Sentry in your function code. See <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aws-lambda/manual-instrumentation/">AWS Lambda Manual Instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
- By adding Sentry to your AWS Lambda container image. See <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aws-lambda/container-image/">AWS Lambda Container Image</PlatformLink>.
